# Descriptions about examples

## Example 1 Particle System
The example code built a particle system with effect that grey particles falling down from the sky. By changing the origin point of system, initial speed, accelerate speed and display color, I changed the effect into blue particles shooting into the sky from ground.
## Example 2 Soft Body
For example 2, it used to be a white Pentagon floating around. I changed it into a color-changing Quadrilateral with a brand new way of moving.
## Example 3 Follow 2
For example 3, I made the Segment longer and change the color of the segment from grey to green. With thinner segment and color of green, it looks like a snake follow our mouse.
